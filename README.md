Image Classification using the FUNDUS dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linchundan/fundusimage1000

After downloading, I'll explore the dataset to understand its structure and the types of images it contains. I have noticed from the first few images and concluded that the given images are in .jpg format

What I am going to do :
1) Preprocess the Data -> resize, normalization and split the dataset for training and testing
2) Build and Train a Model -> choose and train a model. (More likely to build CNN, but I explore some other)
3) Evaluation -> performance measure
4) Visualization ->Through the help of python/R
5) Consideration of other model or tuning the parameters of cnn model to increase the accuracy

### FUNDUS
The term "fundus" typically refers to the bottom or base of something. In medical contexts, it often specifically refers to the bottom or interior surface of an organ, such as the fundus of the eye or the fundus of the uterus.
